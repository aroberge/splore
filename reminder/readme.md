## Notes for myself

Just documenting the steps I used for creating this project.

1. Create a virtual environment for a given Python version:

        $ py -3.8 -m venv ./venv-reminder3.8

2. Write a batch file (ae.bat) as an easy means to activate the virtual environment.

3. Activate the environment

4. Install three packages listed above.

        $ python -m pip install pyinstaller

    etc.

5.
